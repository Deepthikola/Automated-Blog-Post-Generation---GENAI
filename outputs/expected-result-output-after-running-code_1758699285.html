<h1>Expected Result/Output After Running Code</h1>

<p>The code performs the classification of documents into predefined categories using OCR (pattern matching), keyword detection, and an AI-based classifier. Below is the expected result/output after running the code:</p>

<h2>IV. Results</h2>

<p>The system processes documents and categorizes them with confidence scores, ensuring precision and computational efficiency. Unclassified documents are systematically routed to an "unrecognized" folder for manual review, ensuring that no document goes unprocessed and maintaining the system's integrity. The categorized outputs are stored in organized, category-specific folders, providing an accessible structure for downstream processes.  The inclusion of a feedback loop ensures adaptability, enabling the system to evolve by incorporating new templates, refining rules, and retraining AI/ML models with updated data. This continuous improvement mechanism allows the framework to meet dynamic classification needs and adapt to emerging document types.</p>

<p>For example, consider the classification of hospital lab reports.  These documents are automatically organized into the "lab_report" folder, ensuring efficient access and systematic management. The system identifies key terms commonly found in medical lab files and categorizes the documents accordingly. This automated process streamlines the handling of lab-related records, reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and enhancing efficiency in medical data organization.</p>

<p>Similarly, insurance documents are classified based on keywords related to policy numbers, claims, and premiums, facilitating efficient retrieval and processing.</p>
