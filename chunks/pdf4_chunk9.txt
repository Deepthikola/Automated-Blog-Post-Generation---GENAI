ce trained, they 
can predict the category of a document based on its textual content. In cases where the machine learning 
model's confidence is low, fallback mechanisms using pattern-based keyword matching ensure a robust 
classification process [6][7]...  Our The proposed system also integrates preprocessing techniques using 
OpenCV to enhance the quality of images before applying OCR [9][10]. Techniques such as grayscale 
conversion, resizing, and noise removal are employed to standardize do
