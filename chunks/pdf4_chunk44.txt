[5] Ding et al. (2023) review multi-scale and multi-resolution approaches to template matching, where 
document images are processed at different scales and resolutions to enhance the detection of tem-
plates 
[6] Zhao et al. (2022) discuss deep learning methods for template matching, emphasizing the use of 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Transfer learning and data augmentation are also used to 
improve accuracy in template matching
