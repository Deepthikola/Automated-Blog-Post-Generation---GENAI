A SurveyIn the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, this paper examines the use of deep learning 
techniques for document classification. It provides a comprehensive overview of architectures like 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) applied to text 
classification. The authors discuss how deep learning models outperform traditional machine learning 
methods in handling large and complex datasets, including those extracted using OCR from
