ssification and structured data 
extraction using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The proposed solution harnesses OCR 
technology to accurately identify and match document templates by analyzing the layout, structure, 
and textual content of scanned or digital documents. By comparing these features against a 
predefined set of templates, the system enables efficient handling of documents such as invoices, 
forms, and reports, significantly reducing manual intervention and improving accuracy
