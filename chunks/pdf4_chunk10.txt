cument images, ensuring that 
OCR operates with maximum efficiency. Furthermore, the system is designed to handle unrecognized 
documents by segregating them for manual review, thus minimizing the risk of misclassification. 
The proposed system also integrates preprocessing techniques using OpenCV to enhance the quality of 
images before applying OCR [9][10]. Techniques such as grayscale conversion, resizing, and noise 
removal are employed to standardize document images, ensuring that OCR opera
